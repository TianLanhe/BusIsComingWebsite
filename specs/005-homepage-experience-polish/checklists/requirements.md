- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- Validation pass 1: all checklist items pass.
- The spec intentionally records logo source paths because the user explicitly required the website logo to come from the Android App project and to crop out the launcher background.
- The spec intentionally states OpenAPI and service-side DDD as N/A because this feature does not change service-side HTTP API behavior.
- The feature is ready for `/speckit-plan`; planning must create or update Figma nodes before implementation.
